This repository contains a small Rust command line and web based TODO application.
Follow these guidelines when updating code:

- Keep code compatible with the Rust 2021 edition and avoid unstable features.
- Run `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo test` before committing.
- The web UI under `static/` is plain HTML/JavaScript; keep it simple and avoid heavy frameworks.
